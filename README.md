# XMC7000: HYPERRAM&trade; read and write

*Disclaimer: This is a community code example (CCE) released for the benefit of the community users. These projects have only been tested for the listed BSPs, tools versions, and toolchains documented in this readme. They are intended to demonstrate how a solution / concept / use-case can be achieved on a particular device. For official code examples, click [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).*

This example demonstrates interfacing with an external HYPERBUS&trade; memory (HYPERRAM&trade; or PSRAM) and access it using the serial memory interface (SMIF) block of an XMC7200 MCU. This example uses the XMC&trade; MCU standard Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) to build the SMIF APIs.

[View this README on GitHub.](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-xmc72-hyperram-readwrite)

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.3 or later (tested with v3.3)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 2.X
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: [XMC7000 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-cortex-m/)

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v11.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [XMC7200 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_XMC72_EVK) (`KIT_XMC72_EVK`) - Default value of `TARGET`
- [XMC7200 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_XMC72_EVK) (`KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2`)

## Hardware setup

This example uses the XMC7200 Evaluation Kit (KIT_XMC72_EVK, KIT_XMC72_EVK_MUR_43439M2). The kit is designed with SMIF dual header, compatible with Digilent Pmod (J21 and J22) to validate the
HYPERRAM&trade; memory interface. These connectors are not populated by default. External memory modules must be interfaced for validating HYPERRAM&trade;. This example interfaces 128 Mb HYPERRAM&trade; (S70KS1282) with the XMC7200 Evaluation Kit.

To execute "HYPERRAM&trade; read and write", the application board requires the following modifications:

1. Remove board level translators which are interfaced with SMIF Hardware (U18, U19, U20, and U21) as shown in **Figure 1**.

2.	Remove R215, R216, R219, R220, R205, and R212 zero-ohm resistors as shown in **Figure 1**.

3.	Populate R204 and R207 zero-ohm resistors for 3.3 V supply as shown in **Figure 1**.

4.	After removing the U18-U21 ICs, short the pins as shown in **Figure 1**.
      - For U18-U20 connect PIN7 to PIN5, PIN8 to PIN4, PIN9 to PIN3, and PIN10 to PIN2 on the board.
      - For U21 connect PIN7 to PIN5 on the board.

      > **Note:** VTARG has a 3-pin voltage selection header J10 to select between VCC_3V3 or VCC_5V0 voltages. To execute HYPERRAM&trade; read and write application select VCC_3V3 voltage.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[XMC7000: HYPERRAM&trade; read and write](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-xmc72-hyperram-readwrite)" application with the desired name "XMC7000ReadWrite" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id cce-mtb-xmc72-hyperram-readwrite --user-app-name XMC7000ReadWrite --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CCE](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-app-manifest) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays the following terminal output:

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

This example uses the QSPI hardware block for interfacing with the external HYPERBUS&trade; memories (HYPERRAM&trade; / PSRAM) and access it using the serial memory interface (SMIF) block. This example writes 64 bytes of data to the external HYPERRAM&trade; memory in Quad SPI mode. The written data is read back to check its integrity. The UART resource outputs the debug information to a terminal window.

This example uses the [mtb-pdl-cat1](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-pdl-cat1) library along with the memory configuration generated using the QSPI Configurator tool. This tool can be accessed from the **Quick Panel** in Eclipse IDE. This tool generates the configuration files *cycfg_qspi_memslot.c/.h* under the *libs//COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/GeneratedSource* directory based on the memory part selected.

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj | UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the Debug UART port
